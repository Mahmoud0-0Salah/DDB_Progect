# DDB_Progect

## Overview

DDB_Progect is a Go-based project that includes an HTML interface (`index2.html`). The project is structured with Go modules (`go.mod`, `go.sum`) and is organized into multiple branches: `master`, `slave1`, and `slave2`.

## Features

- Modular Design with Go
  - Clean project structure using Go modules for scalable and maintainable development.
- HTML Interface
  - A simple web interface (index2.html) that interacts with the Go backend (can be enhanced for UI/UX or data interaction).
- Branch-Based Architecture
  - Organized into multiple branches (master, slave1, slave2)â€”ideal for simulating distributed systems or collaborative workflows.
